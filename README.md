# Assignment: UI Implementation for Rock Paper Scissors Game

### Objective:
Enhance your Rock Paper Scissors game by adding a user interface (UI) that allows players to interact with the game through buttons. This project focuses on building a simple UI for an existing Rock Paper Scissors game.

### Task:
  - Remove the logic for playing exactly five rounds for now.
  - Create three buttons, one for each selection (Rock, Paper, Scissors).
  - Add an event listener to each button to call the playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. Console.log statements can be retained for this step.
  - Replace all console.log statements related to game results with DOM methods, displaying the results in a designated div.
  - Display the running score and announce the winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.
