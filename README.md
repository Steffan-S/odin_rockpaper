# odin_rockpaper
Repository for the assigment 'rock, paper, scissor' for The Odin Project

This is my first javascript project. The game is played within the browser developer tools console. You can open it on chrome with Option + âŒ˜ + J (on macOS), or Shift + CTRL + J (on Windows/Linux) or right mouse click -> inspect element.

The game is played with 5 rounds. Just type your choice in the pop up window and see the magic happen in your developer console. Good luck
